#! /bin/bash
# This script creates three virtual machines, RHEL-Atomic{01,02,03} completely configured to join a Kubernetes cluster as minions.
# All configuration is done through cloud-init. The configuration data is provided by NoCloud datasource.
# (see http://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/datasources.html#no-cloud for further information)
# Go through all settings in the meta-data and user-data files to make sure the settings match your environment.
# At least you should change the password and put your SSH key into the user-data.

# Warning!
# The static network configuration provided by this example causes NetworkManager to send messages to /usr/bin/dbus-daemon which appearently is denied by SELinux
# This leads to a very long startup time for the VMs
# You need to wait until ssh login becomes available.
#
# Then you need to reboot the VMs to get all network configuration work as designed!!
# If you do not reboot, flannel will not work and you will have both the static and the dhcp address on your interfaces.
